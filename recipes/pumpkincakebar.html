      <li>1/3 cup granulated sugar</li>
      <li>2 Tablespoons pure maple syrup</li>
      <li>1 can pumpkin puree</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cream Cheese Frosting</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>8 ounces cream cheese, softened to room temperature</li>
      <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened to room temperature</li>
      <li>3 cups confectioners’ sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>optional: sprinkles for decorating</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C) and grease a 10×15-inch baking pan. Or
        line the pan with parchment paper with enough overhang on the sides to
        easily lift the bars (as a whole) out.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and pumpkin
        pie spice together in a large bowl. Set aside. Whisk the oil, eggs,
        brown sugar, granulated sugar, maple syrup, pumpkin, and vanilla extract
        together until combined. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry
        ingredients and use a mixer or whisk until completely combined. Batter
        will be thick.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 28-35 minutes. Baking
        times vary, so keep an eye on yours. The bars are done when a toothpick
        inserted in the center comes out clean. If you find the top or edges of
        the bars browning too quickly, loosely tent with aluminum foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the bars from the oven and set the pan on a wire rack. Cool bars
        completely. (After about 45 minutes of cooling, you can place the bars
        in the refrigerator to speed things up!)
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Make the frosting:</b> In a large bowl using a handheld or stand
        mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the cream cheese
        and butter together on high speed until smooth and creamy. Add
        confectioners’ sugar, vanilla, pumpkin pie spice, and salt. Beat on low
        speed for 30 seconds, then switch to high speed and beat for 2 minutes.
        If you want the frosting a little thicker, add an extra 1/4 cup of
        confectioners sugar. Spread the frosting on the cooled bars. To help
        “set” the frosting, refrigerate for 30 minutes before slicing and
        serving. This makes cutting easier and less messy.
      </li>
      <li>Enjoy with or without a fork, but definitely grab a napkin!</li>
      <li>
        Cover leftover bars tightly and store in the refrigerator for up to 5
        days. If you skipped the frosting, cover and store plain pumpkin bars at
        room temperature for up to 3 days or in the refrigerator for up to 1
        week.
